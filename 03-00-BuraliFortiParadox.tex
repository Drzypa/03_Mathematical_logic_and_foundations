\begin{document}
The \emph{Burali-Forti} paradox demonstrates that the class of all ordinals is not a set.  If there were a set of all ordinals, $Ord$, then it would follow that $Ord$ was itself an ordinal, and therefore that $Ord\in Ord$.  \PMlinkescapetext{Even} if sets in general are allowed to contain themselves, ordinals cannot since they are defined so that $\in$ is well founded over them.

This paradox is similar to both Russell's paradox and Cantor's paradox, although it predates both.  All of these paradoxes prove that a certain object is ``too large'' to be a set.
