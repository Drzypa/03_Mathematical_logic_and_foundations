It is easy to see that every constant function between topological 
spaces is continuous. A converse result is as follows.

\begin{thm*}
Suppose $X$ is path connected and $D$ is a countable 
discrete topological space. If $f\colon X\to D$ is continuous,
then $f$ is a constant function.
\end{thm*}

\begin{proof} 
By \PMlinkname{this result}{FiniteAndCountableDiscreteSpaces}
we can assume that $D$ is either $\{1,\ldots, n\}$, $n\ge 2$
or $\Z$, and these are equipped with the subspace topology of $\R$. 
Suppose $f(X)$ has at least two distinct elements, say
$\alpha,\beta\in \Z$ so that 
$$
   f(x)=\alpha, \quad f(y)=\beta
$$
for some $x,y\in X$. Since $X$ is path connected there is a continuous path
$\gamma\colon[0,1]\to X$ such that $\gamma(0)=x$ and $\gamma(1)=y$. 
Then $f\circ\gamma\colon [0,1]\to D$ is continuous. 
Since $D$ has the subspace topology of $\R$, 
  \PMlinkname{this result}{ContinuityIsPreservedWhenCodomainIsExtended}
 implies that 
also $f\circ\gamma\colon [0,1]\to \R$ is continuous. 
 Since $f\circ \gamma$ 
  achieves two different values, it achieves uncountably many values,
  by the intermediate value theorem. 
 This is a contradiction since $f\circ \gamma([0,1])$
 is countable.
\end{proof}
