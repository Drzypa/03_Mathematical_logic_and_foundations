\begin{document}
The definition of countable sets would not serve us well if it did not conform with our intuition about countable sets. So let us prove that countability is in a sense hereditary.
\begin{thm}  Every subset of a countable set is itself countable. \end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Let $B\subseteq A$ and $A$ countable with $f:A\rightarrow K$, $K\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ a bijective function as in the definition of countable sets.

Let us consider $f|_B$, the function  $f$ restricted to $B$, i.e. $f|_B: B \rightarrow f(B)$. Then $f|_B$ is trivially onto, but also one-to-one ($f$ was one-to-one!). So we have a bijective function from $B$ onto $f(B)\subseteq K \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, which \PMlinkescapetext{completes} the proof.
\end{proof}
