\begin{document}
A structured set $S$ (typically a filter or a Boolean algebra) is $\kappa$-complete if, given any $K\subseteq S$ with $|K|<\kappa$, $\bigcap K\in S$.  It is \emph{complete} if it is $\kappa$-complete for all $\kappa$.

Similarly, a partial order is $\kappa$-complete if any sequence of fewer than $\kappa$ elements has an upper bound within the partial order.

A $\aleph_1$-complete \PMlinkescapetext{structure} is called \emph{countably complete}.
