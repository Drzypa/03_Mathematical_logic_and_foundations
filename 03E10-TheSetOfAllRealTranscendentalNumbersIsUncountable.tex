\emph{Theorem.}The set of all real transcendental numbers is uncountable.

\emph{Proof.}
Denote $\mathbb{T}$ and $\mathbb{A}$ be the set of real transcendental and real algebraic numbers respectively. Suppose $\mathbb{T}$ is countable. Then the union $\mathbb{T} \cup \mathbb{A} = \mathbb{R}$ is also countable, since $\mathbb{A}$ is also countable, which is a contradiction. Therefore $\mathbb{T}$ must be uncountable. $\Box$
