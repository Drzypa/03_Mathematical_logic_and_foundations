\begin{document}
If $\langle S_i\rangle_{i<\alpha}$ is a sequence then the \emph{diagonal intersection}, $\Delta_{i<\alpha} S_i$ is defined to be $\{\beta<\alpha\mid\beta\in \bigcap_{\gamma<\beta} S_\gamma\}$.

That is, $\beta$ is in $\Delta_{i<\alpha} S_i$ if it is contained in the first $\beta$ members of the sequence.
