Fuzzy set theory is based on the idea that vague notions as ``big'', ``near'', ``hold'' can be modelled by ``fuzzy subsets''.  The idea of a fuzzy subset $T$ of a set $S$ is the following: each element $x\in S$, there is a number $p\in [0,1]$ such that $p_x$ is the ``probability'' that $x$ is in $T$.  

To formally define a fuzzy set, let us first recall a well-known fact about subsets: a subset $T$ of a set $S$ corresponds uniquely to the characteristic function $c_T:S\to \lbrace 0,1\rbrace$, such that $c_T(x)=1$ iff $x\in T$.  So if one were to replace $\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$ with the the closed unit interval $[0,1]$, one obtains a fuzzy subset:
\begin{quote}
A \emph{fuzzy subset} of a set $S$ is a map $s:S\rightarrow [0,1]$ from $S$ into the interval $[0,1]$. 
\end{quote}
More precisely, the interval $[0,1]$ is considered as a complete lattice with an involution $1-x$. 
We call \textit{fuzzy subset of } $S$ any element of the direct power $[0,1]^S$.  Whereas there are $2^{|S|}$ subsets of $S$, there are $\aleph_1^{|S|}$ fuzzy subsets of $S$.

The join and meet operations in the complete lattice $[0,1]^S$ are named \textit{union} and \textit{intersection}, respectively. The operation induced by the involution is called \textit{complement}. This means that if $s$ and $t$ are two fuzzy subsets, then the fuzzy subsets $s\cup t, s\cap t, -s$, are defined by the equations
$$(s\cup t)(x) = \max\{s(x), t(x)\} \,\,\, ; \,\,\,(s\cap t)(x) = \min\{s(x), t(x)\} \,\,\, ; \,\,\,-s(x) = 1-s(x).$$
It is also possible to consider any lattice $L$ instead of $[0,1]$. In such a case we call $L$\textit{-subset of } $S$ any element of the direct power $L^S$ and the union and the intersection are defined by setting
$$(s\cup t)(x) = s(x)\vee t(x) \,\,\, ; \,\,\,(s\cap t)(x) = s(x)\wedge t(x)$$
where $\vee$ and $\wedge$ denote the join and the meet operations in $L$, respectively. In the case an order reversing function $\neg : L \rightarrow L$ is defined in $L$, the \textit{complement} $-s$ of $s$ is defined by setting
$$-s(x) = \neg s(x).$$
Fuzzy set theory is devoted mainly to applications. The main success is perhaps \textit{fuzzy control}.
