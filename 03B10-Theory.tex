\begin{document}
If $L$ is a logical language for some logic $\mathcal{L}$, a set $T$ of formulas with no free variables is called a \emph{theory} (of $\mathcal{L}$).  If $\mathcal{L}$ is a first-order logic, then $T$ is called a \emph{first-order theory}.

We write $T\vDash \phi$ for any formula $\phi$ if every model $\mathcal{M}$ of $\mathcal{L}$ such that $M\vDash T$, $M\vDash\phi$.

We write $T\vdash\phi$ is for there is a proof of $\phi$ from $T$.

\textbf{Remark}.  Let $S$ be an $L$-structure for some signature $L$. The \emph{theory of $S$} is the set of formulas satisfied by $S$: $$\lbrace \varphi \mid S\models \varphi \rbrace,$$ and is denoted by $\operatorname{Th}(S)$.
