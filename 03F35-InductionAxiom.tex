\begin{document}
An induction axiom specifies that a theory includes induction, possibly restricted to specific formulas.  IND is the general axiom of induction:
$$\phi(0)\wedge\forall x(\phi(x)\rightarrow\phi(x+1))\rightarrow \forall x\phi(x)\text{ for any formula }\phi$$

If $\phi$ is restricted to some family of formulas $F$ then the axiom is called F-IND, or F induction.  For example the axiom $\Sigma^0_1$-IND is:
$$\phi(0)\wedge\forall x(\phi(x)\rightarrow\phi(x+1))\rightarrow \forall x\phi(x)\text{ where }\phi\text{ is }\Sigma^0_1$$
