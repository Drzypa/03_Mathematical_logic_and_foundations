In computability theory, a set $A\subseteq\omega$ is called an \emph{index set} if for all $x, y$,

\begin{equation*}
x\in A, \varphi_x=\varphi_y \Longrightarrow y\in A.
\end{equation*} 

$\varphi_x$ stands for the partial function with G\"odel number (or index) $x$.

Thus, if $A$ is an index set and $\varphi_x=\varphi_y$, then either $x, y\in A$ or $x, y\not\in A$. Intuitively, if $A$ contains the G\"odel index $x$ of a partial function $\varphi$, then $A$ contains all indices for the partial function. (Recall that there are $\aleph_0$ G\"odel numbers for each partial function.)

It is instructive to compare the notion of an index set in computability theory with that of an \emph{indexing} set.
