\begin{document}
If $\mathcal{F}$ is a disjoint family of nonempty sets, then there is a set $C$ which has exactly one element of each $A\in \mathcal{F}$ (i.e such that $A\cap C$ is a singleton for each $A\in \mathcal{F}$.)

This is one of the many propositions that are equivalent to the axiom of choice.
