\begin{document}
$Z_2$ is the full system of second order arithmetic, that is, the full theory of numbers and sets of numbers.  It is sufficient for a great deal of mathematics, including much of number theory and analysis.

The axioms defining successor, addition, multiplication, and comparison are the same as those of PA.  $Z_2$ adds the full induction axiom and the full comprehension axiom.
