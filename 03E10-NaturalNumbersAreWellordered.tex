\begin{document}
In many proofs, one needs the following property of positive and nonnegative integers:\\

\textbf{Theorem.}\, Any non-empty set of natural numbers contains a least number.

\emph{Proof.}\, Let $A$ be an arbitrary non-empty subset of $\mathbb{N}$.\, Denote
$$C \;=\; \{x \in \mathbb{N}\,\vdots\;\; x \leq a\; \forall a \in A\}.$$
Then of course,\, $0 \in C$.\, There exists surely an element $c$ of $C$ such that\, $c\!+\!1 \notin C$,\, since otherwise the induction property would imply that\, $C = \mathbb{N}$.\, Because\, $c\!+\!1 \notin C$,\, there is a number $a_0$ of the set $A$ such that\, $a_0 < c\!+\!1$.\, On the other \PMlinkescapetext{side}, we must have\, $c \leq a_0$.\, Consequently,\, $c = a_0$\, and therefore
$$a_0 \;=\; c \;\leq\; a\;\; \forall a \in A.$$
Hence, $A$ has the least number $a_0$.\, Q.E.D.
