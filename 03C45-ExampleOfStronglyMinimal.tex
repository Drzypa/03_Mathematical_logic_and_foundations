Let $L_{R}$ be the language of rings. 
In other words $L_{R}$ has two constant symbols $0,1$, one unary symbol $-$, and two binary function symbols $+,\cdot$ satisfying the axioms (identities) of a ring.  Let $T$ be the $L_{R}$-theory that includes the field axioms and for each $n$ the formula

\begin{displaymath} \forall x_{0},x_{1},\ldots,x_{n} \exists y (\lnot (\bigwedge_{1 \leq i \leq n}x_{i}=0) \rightarrow \sum_{0 \leq i \leq n}x_{i}y^{i}=0) \end{displaymath}

which expresses that every degree $n$ polynomial which is non constant has a root.  Then any model of $T$ is an algebraically closed field. 

One can show that this is a complete theory and has quantifier elimination (Tarski). 
Thus every $B$-definable subset of any $K \models T$ is definable by a quantifier free formula in $L_{R}(B)$ with one free variable $y$. 
A quantifier free formula is a Boolean combination of atomic formulas. 
Each of these is of the form $\sum_{i\leq n}b_{i}y^{i}=0$ which defines a finite set. 
Thus every definable subset of $K$ is a finite or cofinite set. 
Thus $K$ and $T$ are strongly minimal
