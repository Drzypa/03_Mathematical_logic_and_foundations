For any $X$ there exists a set $Y = \bigcup X$.

The Axiom of Union is an axiom of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.  In symbols, it reads
\[
\forall X \exists Y \forall u (u \in Y \leftrightarrow \exists z (z \in X \land u \in z)).
\]

Notice that this means that $Y$ is the set of elements of all elements of $X$.  More succinctly, the union of any set of sets is a set.  By Extensionality, the set $Y$ is unique.  $Y$ is called the \emph{union} of $X$.

In particular, the Axiom of Union, along with the Axiom of Pairing allows us to define
\[
X \cup Y = \bigcup \{ X, Y \},
\]
as well as the triple
\[
\{ a, b, c \} = \{ a, b \} \cup \{ c \}
\]
and therefore the $n$-tuple
\[
\{ a_1, \ldots, a_n \} = \{ a_1 \} \cup \cdots \cup \{ a_n \}
\]
