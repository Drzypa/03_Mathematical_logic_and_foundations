\begin{document}
A logic is \emph{first order} if it has exactly one type.  Usually the term refers specifically to the logic with connectives $\neg$, $\vee$, $\wedge$, $\rightarrow$, and $\leftrightarrow$ and the quantifiers $\forall$ and $\exists$, all given the usual semantics:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\neg\phi$ is true iff $\phi$ is not true

\item $\phi\vee\psi$ is true if either $\phi$ is true or $\psi$ is true

\item $\forall x\phi(x)$ is true iff $\phi^t_x$ is true for every object $t$ (where $\phi^t_x$ is the result of replacing every unbound occurrence of $x$ in $\phi$ with $t$)

\item $\phi\wedge\psi$ is the same as $\neg(\neg\phi\vee\neg\psi)$

\item $\phi\rightarrow\psi$ is the same as $(\neg\phi)\vee\psi$

\item $\phi\leftrightarrow\psi$ is the same as $(\phi\rightarrow\psi)\wedge(\psi\rightarrow\phi)$

\item $\exists x\phi(x)$ is the same as $\neg\forall x\neg\phi(x)$
\end{itemize}

However languages with slightly different quantifiers and connectives are sometimes still called first order as long as there is only one type.
