\begin{document}
A logic is said to have the \emph{Beth property} if whenever a predicate $R$ is implicitly definable by $\phi$ (i.e. if all models have at most one unique extension satisfying $\phi$), then $R$ is explicitly definable relative to $\phi$ (i.e. there is a $\psi$ not containing $R$,such that $\phi \models \forall x_1, .., x_n (R(x_1,...,x_n) \leftrightarrow \psi(x_1,...,x_n))$).
