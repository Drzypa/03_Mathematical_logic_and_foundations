\begin{document}
{\sl Circular reasoning\/} is an attempted proof of a statement that uses at least one of the following two things:

\begin{itemize}
\item the statement that is to be proven
\item a fact that relies on the statement that is to be proven
\end{itemize}

Such proofs are not valid.

As an example, below is a faulty proof that the \PMlinkname{well-ordering principle implies the axiom of choice}{WellOrderingPrincipleImpliesAxiomOfChoice}.  The step where circular reasoning is used is surrounded by brackets [ ].

Let $C$ be a collection of nonempty sets.  By the well-ordering principle, each $S \in C$ is well-ordered.  [For each $S \in C$, let $<_S$ denote the well-ordering of $S$.]  Let $m_S$ denote the least member of each $S \in C$ with respect to $<_S$.  Then a choice function $\displaystyle f \colon C \to \bigcup_{S \in C} S$ can be defined by $f(S)=m_S$.

The step surrounded by brackets is faulty because it actually uses the axiom of choice, which is what is to be proven.  In the step, for each $S \in C$, an ordering is chosen.  This cannot be done in general without appealing to the axiom of choice.
