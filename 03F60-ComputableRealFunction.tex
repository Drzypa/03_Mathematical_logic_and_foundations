A function $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is \emph{sequentially computable} if, for every computable sequence $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ of real numbers, the sequence $\{f(x_i) \}_{i=1}^\infty$ is also computable.

A function $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is \emph{effectively uniformly continuous} if there exists a recursive function $d \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that, if
 $$|x-y| < {1 \over d(n)}$$
then
 $$|f(x) - f(y)| < {1 \over n}$$

A real function is \emph{computable} if it is both sequentially computable and effectively uniformly continuous.

It is not hard to generalize these definitions to functions of more than one variable or functions only defined on a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  The generalizations of the latter two definitions are so obvious that they need not be restated.  A suitable generalization of the first definition is:

Let $D$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  A function $f \colon D \to \mathbb{R}$ is \emph{sequentially computable} if, for every $n$-tuplet $\left( \{ x_{i \, 1} \}_{i=1}^\infty, \ldots \{ x_{i \, n} \}_{i=1}^\infty \right)$ of computable sequences of real numbers such that
 $$(\forall i) \quad (x_{i \, 1}, \ldots x_{i \, n}) \in D \qquad ,$$
the sequence $\{f(x_i) \}_{i=1}^\infty$ is also computable.
