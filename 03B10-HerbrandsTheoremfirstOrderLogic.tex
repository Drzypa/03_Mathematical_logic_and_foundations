\begin{document}
Let $T$ be a first-order theory consisting of open formulas only.  Then:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $T$ is satisfiable, it has a Herbrand model
\item If $T$ is not satisfiable, there is a finite subset of the set of ground instances of formulas of $T$ which is unsatisfiable.
\end{enumerate}
