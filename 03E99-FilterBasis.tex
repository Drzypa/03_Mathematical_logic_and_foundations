A \emph{filter subbasis} for a set $S$ is a collection of subsets of $S$ which has the finite intersection property.

A \emph{filter basis} $B$ for a set $S$ is a non-empty collection of subsets of $S$ which does not contain the empty set such that, for every $u \in B$ and every $v \in B$, there exists a $w \in B$ such that $w \subset u \cap v$.

Given a filter basis $B$ for a set $S$, the set of all supersets of elements of $B$ forms a filter on the set $S$.  This filter is known as the filter generated by the basis.

Given a filter subbasis $B$ for a set $S$, the set of all supersets of finite intersections of elements of $B$ is a filter.  This filter is known as the filter generated by the subbasis.

Two filter bases are said to be \emph{equivalent} if they generate the same filter.  Likewise, two filter subbases are said to be equivalent if they generate the same filter.

\textbf{Note:}  Not every author requires that filters do not contain the empty set. 
Because every filter is a filter basis then accordingly some authors allow that a filter 
base can contain the empty set.
