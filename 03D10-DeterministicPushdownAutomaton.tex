A pushdown automaton $M=(Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,T,q_0,\bot,F)$ is usually called ``non-deterministic'' because the image of the transition function $T$ is a subset of $Q\times \Gamma^*$, which may possibly contain more than one element.  In other words, the transition from one configuration to the next is not uniquely determined.  When there is uniqueness, $M$ is called ``deterministic''.

Formally, a \emph{deterministic pushdown automaton}, or \emph{DPDA} for short, is a non-deterministic pushdown automaton $M=(Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,T,q_0,\bot,F)$ where the transition function $T$ has the following properties: for any $p\in Q$, $a\in \Sigma$, and $A\in \Gamma$,
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T(p,a,A)\cup T(p,\lambda,A)$ is at most a singleton,
\item $T(p,a,A)\cap T(p,\lambda,A)=\varnothing$.
\end{enumerate}
The properties can be interpreted as follows: given any configuration of $M$, if there is a transition to the next configuration, the transition must be unique.  The second property just insures that $T(p,a,A)\ne T(p,\lambda,A)$, so that when a $\lambda$-transition is possible for a given $(p,A)$, no other transitions are possible for the same $(p,A)$.

The way a DPDA works is exactly the same as an NPDA, with several modes of acceptance: acceptance on final state, acceptance on empty stack, and acceptance on final state and empty stack.  However, unlike a NPDA, these acceptance methods are not equivalent.  It can be shown that the set $\mathscr{E}$ of languages accepted on empty stack is a proper subset of the set $\mathscr{F}$ of languages determined on final state.  In fact, every language in $\mathscr{E}$ is prefix-free, while some languages in $\mathscr{F}$ are not.

Nevertheless, any regular language can be accepted by a DPDA on empty stack, and any language accepted by a DPDA on final state is unambiguous, and, as a result, $\mathscr{F}$ is a proper subset of the family of all context-free languages.  This is quite unlike the case for finite automata: every non-deterministic finite automaton is equivalent to a deterministic finite automaton.  A language in $\mathscr{F}$ called a \emph{deterministic language}.

Some examples: the set of palindromes $\lbrace u \in \Sigma^* \mid u = \operatorname{rev}(u) \rbrace$ is unambiguous, but not deterministic.  The language $\lbrace a^m b^n \mid m \ge n \ge 0 \rbrace$ is deterministic, but not prefix-free, and hence can not be accepted by any DPDA on empty stack.  The language $\lbrace a^n b^n \mid n\ge 0 \rbrace$ can be accepted by a DPDA on empty stack, but is not regular.

Any formal grammar that generates a deterministic language is said to be \emph{deterministic context-free}.  A deterministic context-free grammar can be described by what is known as the \PMlinkname{$LR(k)$}{LRk} grammars.

The family of deterministic languages is closed under complementation, intersection with a regular language, but not arbitrary (finite) intersection, and hence not union.

\textbf{Remark}.  The reason why $\mathscr{E}\ne \mathscr{F}$ can be traced back to the definition of a DPDA: it allows for the following possibilities for a DPDA $M$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $M$ completely stops reading an input word because either there are no available transitions from one configuration to the next: $$T(p,a,A)\cup T(p,\lambda,A)=\varnothing,$$ or the stack is emptied before the last input symbol is read: a configuration $(p,u,\lambda)$ is reached and $u$ is not empty.
\item $M$ consumes the last input symbol, and continues processing because of $\lambda$-transitions.
\end{itemize}
Some authors consider these imperfections of $M$ as being ``non-deterministic'', and put additional constraints on $M$, such as making sure $T$ is a total function, the stack is never empty, and delimiting input strings.
