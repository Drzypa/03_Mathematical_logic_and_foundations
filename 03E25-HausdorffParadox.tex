Let $S^2$ be the unit sphere in the Euclidean space $\mbb{R}^3$. Then
it is possible to take ``half'' and ``a third'' of $S^2$ such that
both of these parts are essentially congruent (we give a formal
version in a minute). This sounds paradoxical:
wouldn't that mean that half of the sphere's area is equal to only a
third? The ``paradox'' resolves itself if one takes into account that
one can choose non-measurable subsets of the sphere which ostensively are ``half'' and a ``third'' of it, using geometric congruence as means of comparison.

Let us now formally state the Theorem.

\newtheorem*{thm}{Theorem}
\begin{thm}[Hausdorff paradox~\cite{H}]
There exists a disjoint \PMlinkescapetext{decomposition} of the unit sphere $S^2$ in the
Euclidean space $\mbb{R}^3$ into four subsets $A,B,C,D$, such that the
following conditions are met:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Any two of the sets $A$, $B$, $C$ and $B\cup C$ are congruent.
\item $D$ is countable.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

A crucial ingredient to the proof is the \PMlinkid{axiom of choice}{310}, so the
sets $A$, $B$ and $C$ are not constructible. The theorem itself is a
crucial ingredient to the proof of the so-called Banach-Tarski
paradox.
