\begin{document}
Galileo Galilei (1564---1642) has realised the ostensible contradiction in the situation, that although the set
$$1,\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5,\,\ldots$$
of the positive integers \PMlinkescapetext{contains} all the members of the set
$$1,\,4,\,9,\,16,\,\ldots$$
of the perfect squares and in \PMlinkescapetext{addition} many others, however both sets are equally great in the sense that any member of the former set has as its square a unique counterpart in the latter set and also any member of the latter set has as its square root a unique counterpart in the former set.\, Galileo explained this by the infinitude of the sets.

In modern mathematical \PMlinkescapetext{expressions}, we say that an infinite set and its proper subset set may have the same cardinality.
