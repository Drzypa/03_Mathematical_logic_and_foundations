\textbf{Theorem.}\; For a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, the set of the 
\PMlinkname{discontinuity}{Continuous} 
points of the characteristic function $\chi_A$ is the 
\PMlinkname{boundary}{BoundaryFrontier} of $A$.\\

{\it Proof.}\, Let $a$ be a discontinuity point of $\chi_A$.\, Then any 
\PMlinkname{neighborhood}{Neighborhood} of $a$ 
contains the points $b$ and $c$ such that\, $\chi_A(b) = 1$\, and\, $\chi_A(c) = 0$.\, Thus\, 
$b \in A$\, and\, $c \notin A$,\, whence $a$ is a boundary point of $A$.

If, on the contrary, $a$ is a boundary point of $A$ and $U(a)$ an arbitrary neighborhood of 
$a$, it follows that $U(a)$ contains both points belonging to $A$ and points not belonging to 
$A$.\, So we have in $U(a)$ the points $b$ and $c$ such that\, $\chi_A(b) = 1$\, and\, 
$\chi_A(c) = 0$.\, This means that $\chi_A$ cannot be continuous at the point $a$ (N.B. that
one does not need to know the value $\chi_A(a)$).
