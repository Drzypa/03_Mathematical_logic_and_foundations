<div id="p1" class="ltx_para">

<p class="ltx_p">In a nutshell, the logico-deductive method is a system of inference
where conclusions (new knowledge) follow from premises (old knowledge)
through the application of sound arguments (syllogisms, rules of
inference). Tautologies excluded, nothing can be deduced if nothing
is assumed. Axioms and postulates are the basic assumptions
underlying a given body of deductive knowledge. They are accepted
without demonstration. All other assertions (theorems, if we are
talking about mathematics) must be proven with the aid of the basic
assumptions.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The logico-deductive method was developed by the ancient Greeks, and
has become the core principle of modern mathematics. However, the
interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient
times to the modern, and consequently the terms <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">axiom</em> and
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">postulate</em> hold a slightly different meaning for the present day
mathematician, then they did for Aristotle and Euclid.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The ancient Greeks considered geometry as just one of several
sciences, and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific
facts. As such, they developed and used the logico-deductive method
as a means of avoiding error, and for structuring and communicating
knowledge. Aristotle’s <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/posterior.1.i.html</span>Posterior
Analytics
is a definitive exposition of the classical view.</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">“Axiom”, in classical terminology, referred to a self-evident assumption
common to many branches of science. A good example would be the
assertion that</p>
<blockquote class="ltx_quote">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">When an equal amount is taken from equals, an equal amount results.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">At the foundation of the various sciences lay certain basic hypotheses
that had to be accepted without proof. Such a hypothesis was termed a
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">postulate</em>. The postulates of each science were different.
Their validity had to be established by means of real-world
experience. Indeed, Aristotle warns that the content of a science
cannot be successfully communicated, if the learner is in doubt about
the truth of the postulates.</p>

</div>
<div id="p7" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">A great lesson learned by mathematics in the last 150 years is that it
is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions
(axioms, postulates, propositions, theorems) and definitions. This
abstraction, one might even say formalization, makes mathematical
knowledge more general, capable of multiple different meanings, and
therefore useful in multiple contexts.</p>
</div>
<div id="p8" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In structuralist mathematics we go even further, and develop theories
and axioms (like field theory, group theory, topology, vector spaces)
without <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">any</em> particular application in mind. The distinction
between an “axiom” and a “postulate” disappears. The postulates of
Euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great
wealth of geometric facts. The truth of these complicated facts rests
on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses. However by throwing out
postulate 5, we get theories that have meaning in wider contexts,
hyperbolic geometry for example. We must simply be prepared to use
labels like “line” and “parallel” with greater flexibility. The
development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that
postulates should be regarded as purely formal statements, and not as
facts based on experience.</p>
</div>
<div id="p9" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">When mathematicians employ the axioms of a field, the intentions are
even more abstract. The propositions of field theory do not concern
any one particular application; the mathematician now works in
complete abstraction. There are many examples of fields; field
theory gives correct knowledge in all contexts.</p>
</div>
<div id="p10" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are
“propositions that are regarded as true without proof.” Rather, the
Field Axioms are a set of constraints. If any given system of
addition and multiplication tolerates these constraints, then one is
in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information
about this system. There is a lot of bang for the formalist buck.</p>
</div>
<div id="p11" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Modern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an
extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical
objects, and logic itself can be regarded as a branch of mathematics.
Frege, Russell, Poincaré, Hilbert, and Gödel are some of
the key figures in this development.</p>
</div>
<div id="p12" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In the modern understanding, a set of axioms is any collection of
formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions
follow by the application of certain well-defined rules. In this
view, logic becomes just another formal system. A set of axioms
should be consistent; it should be impossible to derive a
contradiction from the axiom. A set of axioms should also be
non-redundant; an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need
not be regarded as an axiom.</p>
</div>
<div id="p13" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of
mathematics, perhaps all of mathematics, could be derived from a
consistent collection of basic axioms. An early success of the
formalist program was Hilbert’s formalization of Euclidean geometry,
and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms.</p>
</div>
<div id="p14" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on
Cantor’s set theory. Here the emergence of Russell’s paradox, and
similar antinomies of naive set theory raised the possibility that any
such system could turn out to be inconsistent.</p>
</div>
<div id="p15" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The formalist project suffered a decisive setback, when in 1931
Gödel showed that it is possible, for any sufficiently large set of
axioms (Peano’s axioms, for example) to construct a statement whose
truth is independent of that set of axioms. As a corollary, Gödel
proved that the consistency of a theory like Peano arithmetic is an
unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory.</p>
</div>
<div id="p16" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It is reasonable to believe in the consistency of Peano arithmetic
because it is satisfied by the system of natural numbers, an infinite
but intuitively accessible formal system. However, at this date we
have no way of demonstrating the consistency of modern set theory
(Zermelo-Frankel axioms). The axiom of choice, a key hypothesis
of this theory, remains a very controversial assumption.
Furthermore, using techniques of forcing (Cohen) one can show that the
continuum hypothesis (Cantor) is independent of the Zermelo-Frankel
axioms. Thus, even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded
as the definitive foundation for mathematics.
