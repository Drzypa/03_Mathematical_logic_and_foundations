\begin{document}
$\clubsuit_S$ is a combinatoric principle weaker than $\Diamond_S$.  It states that, for $S$ stationary in $\kappa$, there is a sequence $\langle A_\alpha\rangle_{\alpha\in S}$ such that $A_\alpha\subseteq\alpha$ and $\operatorname{sup}(A_\alpha)=\alpha$ and with the property that for each unbounded subset $T\subseteq\kappa$ there is some $A_\alpha\subseteq X$.

Any sequence satisfying $\Diamond_S$ can be adjusted so that $\operatorname{sup}(A_\alpha)=\alpha$, so this is indeed a weakened form of $\Diamond_S$.

Any such sequence actually contains a stationary set of $\alpha$ such that $A_\alpha\subseteq T$ for each $T$: given any club $C$ and any unbounded $T$, construct a $\kappa$ sequence, $C^*$ and $T^*$, from the elements of each, such that the $\alpha$-th member of $C^*$ is greater than the $\alpha$-th member of $T^*$, which is in turn greater than any earlier member of $C^*$.  Since both sets are unbounded, this construction is possible, and $T^*$ is a subset of $T$ still unbounded in $\kappa$.  So there is some $\alpha$ such that $A_\alpha\subseteq T^*$, and since $\operatorname{sup}(A_\alpha)=\alpha$, $\alpha$ is also the limit of a subsequence of $C^*$ and therefore an element of $C$.
