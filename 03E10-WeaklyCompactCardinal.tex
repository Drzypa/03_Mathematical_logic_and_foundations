\begin{document}
Weakly compact cardinals are (large) infinite cardinals which have a property related to the syntactic compactness theorem for first order logic.  Specifically, for any infinite cardinal $\kappa$, consider the language $L_{\kappa,\kappa}$.  

This language is identical to \PMlinkescapeword{normal} first \PMlinkescapeword{order} logic except that:

\begin{itemize}
\item infinite conjunctions and disjunctions of fewer than $\kappa$ formulas are allowed
\item infinite strings of fewer than $\kappa$ quantifiers are allowed
\end{itemize}

The weak compactness theorem for $L_{\kappa,\kappa}$ states that if $\Delta$ is a set of sentences of $L_{\kappa,\kappa}$ such that $|\Delta|=\kappa$ and any $\theta\subset\Delta$ with $|\theta|<\kappa$ is consistent then $\Delta$ is consistent.

A cardinal is weakly compact if the weak compactness theorem holds for $L_{\kappa,\kappa}$.
