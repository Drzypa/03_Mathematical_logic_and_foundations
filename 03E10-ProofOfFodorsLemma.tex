\begin{document}
If we let $f^{-1}:\kappa\rightarrow P(S)$ be the inverse of $f$ restricted to $S$ then Fodor's lemma is equivalent to the claim that for any function such that $\alpha\in f(\kappa)\rightarrow \alpha>\kappa$ there is some $\alpha\in S$ such that $f^{-1}(\alpha)$ is stationary.

Then if Fodor's lemma is false, for every $\alpha\in S$ there is some club set $C_\alpha$ such that $C_\alpha\cap f^{-1}(\alpha)=\emptyset$.  Let $C=\Delta_{\alpha<\kappa} C_\alpha$.  The club sets are closed under diagonal intersection, so $C$ is also club and therefore there is some $\alpha\in S\cap C$.  Then $\alpha\in C_\beta$ for each $\beta<\alpha$, and so there can be no $\beta<\alpha$ such that $\alpha\in f^{-1}(\beta)$, so $f(\alpha)\geq\alpha$, a contradiction.
