 {\bf Theorem} Suppose $X$ is a set. 
 Then a mapping $f:X\to X$ \PMlinkname{of period}{PeriodOfMapping} $n$ is 
a bijection. 
 
 {\bf Proof.} If $n=1$, the claim is trivial;
 $f$ is the identity mapping.
Suppose $n=2,3,\ldots$.  
Then for any $x\in X$, we have $x=f\big(f^{n-1}(x)\big)$,
so $f$ is an surjection. To see that $f$ is a injection,
suppose $f(x)=f(y)$ for some $x,y$ in $X$. Since $f^n$
is the identity, it follows that $x=y$.  $\Box$
