Since there are only $\aleph_0$ possible cardinalities for any element of $S$, there must be some $n$ such that there are an uncountable number of elements of $S$ with cardinality $n$.  Let $S^*=\{a\in S\mid |a|=n\}$ for this $n$.  By induction, the lemma holds:

If $n=1$ then there each element of $S^*$ is distinct, and has no intersection with the others, so $X=\emptyset$ and $S^\prime=S^*$.

Suppose $n>1$.  If there is some $x$ which is in an uncountable number of elements of $S^*$ then take $S^{**}=\{a\setminus\{x\}\mid x\in a\in S^*\}$.  Obviously this is uncountable and every element has $n-1$ elements, so by the induction hypothesis there is some $S^\prime\subseteq S^{**}$ of uncountable cardinality such that the intersection of any two elements is $X$.  Obviously $\{a\cup\{x\}\mid a\in S^\prime\}$ satisfies the lemma, since the intersection of any two elements is $X\cup\{x\}$.

On the other hand, if there is no such $x$ then we can construct a sequence $\langle a_i\rangle_{i<\omega_1}$ such that each $a_i\in S^*$ and for any $i\neq j$, $a_i\cap a_j=\emptyset$ by induction.  Take any element for $a_0$, and given $\langle a_i\rangle_{i<\alpha}$, since $\alpha$ is countable, $A=\bigcup_{i<\alpha} a_i$ is countable.  Obviously each element of $A$ is in only a countable number of elements of $S^*$, so there are an uncountable number of elements of $S^*$ which are candidates for $a_\alpha$.  Then this sequence satisfies the lemma, since the intersection of any two elements is $\emptyset$.
