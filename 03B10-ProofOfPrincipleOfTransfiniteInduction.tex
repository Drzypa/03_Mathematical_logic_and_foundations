\begin{document}
To prove the transfinite induction theorem, we note that the class of ordinals is well-ordered by $\in$.  So suppose for some $\Phi$, there are ordinals $\alpha$ such that $\Phi(\alpha)$ is not true.  Suppose further that $\Phi$ satisfies the hypothesis, i.e. 
$\forall\alpha(\forall\beta<\alpha(\Phi(\beta))\Rightarrow\Phi(\alpha))$.  We will reach a contradiction.  

The class $C=\{\alpha:\neg\Phi(\alpha)\}$ is not empty.  Note that it may be a proper class, but this is not important.  Let $\gamma=\min(C)$ be the $\in$-minimal element of $C$.  Then by assumption, for every $\lambda<\gamma$, $\Phi(\lambda)$ is true.  Thus, by hypothesis, $\Phi(\gamma)$ is true, contradiction.
