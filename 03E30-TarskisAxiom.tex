\begin{document}
Tarski proposed the following axiom for set theory:

For every set $S$, there exists a set $U$ which enjoys the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item $S$ is an element of $U$
\item For every element $X \in U$, every subset of $X$ is also an element of $U$.
\item For every element $X \in U$, the power set of $X$ is also an element of $U$.
\item Every subset of $U$ whose cardinality is less than the cardinality of $U$ is  an element of $U$.
\end{itemize}

This axiom implies the axiom of choice.  It also implies the existence of inaccessible cardinal numbers.
