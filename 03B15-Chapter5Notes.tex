Inductive definitions have a long pedigree in mathematics, arguably going back at least to Frege and Peano's axioms for the natural numbers.\index{Frege}\index{Peano} % 
More general ``inductive predicates'' are not uncommon, but in set theoretic foundations they are usually constructed explicitly, either as an intersection of an appropriate class of subsets or using transfinite iteration along the ordinals, rather than regarded as a basic notion.

In type theory, particular cases of inductive definitions date back to Martin-L\"of's original papers: \cite{martin-lof-hauptsatz} presents a general notion of inductively defined predicates and relations; the notion of inductive type was present (but only with instances, not as a general notion) in Martin-L\"of's first papers in type theory \cite{Martin-Lof-1973};
and then as a general notion with $\w$-types in \cite{Martin-Lof-1979}.\index{Martin-L\"of}%

A general notion of inductive type was introduced in 1985 by Constable and Mendler~\cite{DBLP:conf/lop/ConstableM85}.  A general schema for inductive types in intensional type theory was suggested in
\cite{PfenningPaulinMohring}.  Further developments included \cite{CoquandPaulin},\cite{ Dybjer:1991}.

The notion of inductive-recursive definition appears in \cite{Dybjer:2000}. An important  type-theoretic notion is the notion of tree types (a general expression of the notion of Post system in type theory) which appears in \cite{PeterssonSynek}.

The universal property of the natural numbers as an initial object of the category of $\nat$-algebras is due to Lawvere \cite{lawvere:adjinfound}\index{Lawvere}.
This was later generalized to a description of $\w$-types as initial algebras for polynomial endofunctors by~\cite{mp:wftrees}.\index{endofunctor!algebra for}
The coherently homotopy-theoretic equivalence between such universal properties and the corresponding induction principles (\PMlinkname{\S 5.4}{54inductivetypesareinitialalgebras},\PMlinkname{\S 5.5}{55homotopyinductivetypes}) is due to~\cite{ags:it-hott}.

For actual constructions of inductive types in homotopy-theoretic semantics of type theory, see~\cite{klv:ssetmodel},\cite{mvdb:wtypes},\cite{ls:hits}.
