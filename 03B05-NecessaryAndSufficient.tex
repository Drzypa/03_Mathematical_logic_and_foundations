\PMlinkescapeword{terms}

The statement ``$p$ is {\sl necessary\/} for $q$'' \PMlinkescapetext{means} ``$q$ \PMlinkname{implies}{Implication} $p$''.

The statement ``$p$ is {\sl sufficient\/} for $q$'' \PMlinkescapetext{means} ``$p$ \PMlinkname{implies}{Implication} $q$''.

The statement ``$p$ is {\sl necessary and sufficent\/} for $q$'' \PMlinkescapetext{means} ``$p$ \PMlinkname{if and only if}{Iff} $q$''.

For an example of how these terms are used in mathematics, see the entry on complete ultrametric fields.

Biconditional statements are often proven by breaking them into two implications and proving them separately.  Often, the terms \emph{necessity} and \emph{sufficiency} are used to indicate which implication is being proven.  For an example of this usage, see the entry called relationship between totatives and divisors.
