\begin{document}
$\mathcal{NK}p$ is a natural deduction proof system for classical propositional logic.  It is identical to NJp except that it replaces the rule $\bot_i$ with the rule:

$$\frac{\Gamma,\neg\alpha\Rightarrow\bot}{\Gamma\Rightarrow\alpha}(\bot_c),\quad \text{ where }\alpha\text{ is atomic}.$$
