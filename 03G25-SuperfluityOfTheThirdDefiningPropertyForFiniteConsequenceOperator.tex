\newtheorem*{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{document}
In this entry, we demonstrate the claim made in section 1 of the 
\PMlinkid{parent entry}{8646} that the defining conditions for 
finitary consequence operator given there are redundant because
one of them may be derived from the other two.

\begin{theorem}
Let $L$ be a set.  Suppose that a mapping $C \colon \mathcal{P}(L) 
\to \mathcal{P}(L)$ satisfies the following three properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For all $X \subseteq L$, it happens that $X \subseteq C(X)$.
\item $C \circ C = C$
\item For all $X \in L$, it happens that $C(X) = \bigcup\limits_{Y \in 
\mathcal{F} (X)} C(Y)$.
\end{enumerate}
Then $ C$ also satisfies the following property:  For all $X, Y 
\subseteq L$, if $X \subseteq Y$, then $C(X) \subseteq C(Y)$.
\end{theorem}
