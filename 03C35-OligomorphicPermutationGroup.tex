\begin{document}
A permutation group acting on a countably
infinite set is called \emph{oligomorphic},
if it has finitely many orbits of $n$-tuples,
for all $n \geq 1$.

Ryll-Nardzewski, Engeler, and Svenonius proved that
a countably infinite first-order structure has an oligomorphic
automorphism group if and only if the structure is
$\omega$-categorical.
