Every field of sets is a ring of sets.  Below are some examples of rings of sets that are not fields of sets.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $A$ be a non-empty set containing an element $a$.  Let $\mathcal{R}$ be the family of subsets of $A$ containing $a$.  Then $\mathcal{R}$ is a ring of sets, but not a field of sets, since $\lbrace a\rbrace \in \mathcal{R}$, but $A-\lbrace a\rbrace \notin \mathcal{R}$.
\item The collection of all open sets of a topological space is a ring of sets, which is in general not a field of sets, unless every open set is also closed.  Likewise, the collection of all closed sets of a topological space is also a ring of sets.
\item
A simple example of a ring of sets is the subset $\{ \{a\}, \{a,b\} \}$
of $2^{\{a,b\}}$.  That this is a ring of sets follows from the
observations that $\{a\} \cap \{a,b\} = \{a\}$ and $\{a\} \cup \{a,b\}
= \{a,b\}$.  Note that it is not a field of sets because the
complement of $\{a\}$, which is $\{b\}$, does not belong to the ring.
\item
Another example involves an infinite set.  Let $A$ be an infinite set.  Let $\mathcal{R}$ be the collection of finite subsets of $A$.  Since the union and the intersection of two finite set are finite sets, $\mathcal{R}$ is a ring of sets.  However, it is not a field of sets, because the complement of a finite subset of $A$ is infinite, and thus not a member of $\mathcal{R}$.
