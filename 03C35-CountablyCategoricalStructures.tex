\begin{document}
A countably infinite structure is called \emph{countably categorical} (also called \emph{$\omega$-categorical}, or \emph{$\aleph_0$-categorical})
if all countable models of its first-order theory are isomorphic.

Ryll-Nardzewski, Engeler, and Svenonius proved that a
countable structure is $\omega$-categorical if and only if
it has an oligomorphic automorphism group.
