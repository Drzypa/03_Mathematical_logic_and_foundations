\begin{document}
A \emph{sequent} represents a formal step in a proof.  Typically it consists of two lists of formulas, one representing the premises and one the conclusions.  A typical sequent might be:
$$\phi,\psi\Rightarrow\alpha,\beta$$
where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are the premises and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the conclusions.

This claims that, from premises $\phi$ and $\psi$ either $\alpha$ or $\beta$ must be true.  Note that $\Rightarrow$ is not a symbol in the language, rather it is a symbol in the metalanguage used to discuss proofs.  Also, notice the asymmetry: everything on the left must be true to conclude only one thing on the right.  This does create a different kind of symmetry, since adding formulas to either side results in a weaker sequent, while removing them from either side gives a stronger one.

Some systems allow only one formula on the right.

Most proof systems provide ways to deduce one sequent from another.  These rules are written with a list of sequents above and below a line.  This rule indicates that if everything above the line is true, so is everything under the line.  A typical rule is:

$$\frac{\Gamma\Rightarrow\Sigma}{\begin{array}{cc}
\Gamma,\alpha\Rightarrow\Sigma &
\alpha,\Gamma\Rightarrow\Sigma
\end{array}}$$

This indicates that if we can deduce $\Sigma$ from $\Gamma$, we can also deduce it from $\Gamma$ together with $\alpha$.

Note that the capital Greek letters are usually used to denote a (possibly empty) list of formulas.  $[\Gamma,\Sigma]$ is used to denote the \emph{contraction} of $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$, that is, the list of those formulas appearing in either $\Gamma$ or $\Sigma$ but with no repeats.
